### Nine Lives Deep

Nine Lives Deep is a game combining elements of roguelike with the classic game of Minesweeper. 
In it, you play as a cat, finding a path through unique floors filled with special tiles, mines with unique abilities, entities that may help or hinder you, and items and consumables, which you'll have to make the most out of to win.

The game is still under development, but is playable in [beta](https://lennyyyyyyyy.itch.io/nine-lives-deep)!

### Nine Lives Deep

Nine Lives Deep is a game combining elements of roguelike with the classic game of Minesweeper. 
In it, you play as a cat, finding a path through unique floors filled with special tiles, mines with unique abilities, entities that may help or hinder you, and items and consumables - which you'll have to make the most out of to win.

The game is currently in development using the Unity engine.
